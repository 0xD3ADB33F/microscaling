/*
Force12.io is a package that monitors demand for resource in a system and then scales and repurposes
containers, based on agreed "quality of service" contracts, to best handle that demand within the constraints of your existing VM or physical infrastructure (for v1).

Force12 is defined to optimize the use of existing physical and VM resources instantly. VMs cannot be scaled in real time (it takes several minutes) and new physical machines take even longer. However, containers can be started or stopped at sub second speeds, allowing your infrastructure to adapt itself in real time to meet system demands.

Force12 is aimed at effectively using the resources you have right now - your existing VMs or physical servers - by using them as optimally as possible.

The Force12 approach is analogous to the way that a router dynamically optimises the use of a physical network. A router is limited by the capacity of the lines physically connected to it. Adding additional capacity is a physical process and takes time. Routers therefore make decisions in real time about which packets will be prioritized on a particular line based on the packet's priority (defined by a "quality of service" contract).

For example, at times of high bandwidth usage a router might prioritize VOIP traffic over web browsing in real time.

Containers allow Force12 to make similar "instant" judgements on service prioritisation within your existing infrastructure. Routers make very simplistic
judgments because they have limited time and cpu and they act at a per packet level. Force12 has the capability of making far more
sophisticated judgements, although even fairly simple ones will still provide a significant new service.

This prototype is a bare bones implementation of Force12.io that recognises only 1 demand types
randomised demand for a priority 1 service (the current value stored in Consul's key value store) aka "client". WHen this minimum demand has been met then a P2 service will
be run (aka "server).

These demand type examples have been chosen purely for simplicity of demonstration. In the future more demand types
will be offered

V1 - Force12.io reacts to increased demand by starting/stopping containers on the slaves already in play.

Note - this version of Force12 starts and stops containers on a Mesos cluser using Marathon as the scheduler
