// Force12.io is a package that monitors demand for resource in a system and then scales and repurposes
// containers, based on agreed "quality of service" contracts, to best handle that demand within the constraints of your existing VM
// or physical infrastructure (for v1).
//
// Force12 is defined to optimize the use of existing physical and VM resources instantly. VMs cannot be scaled in real time (it takes
// several minutes) and new physical machines take even longer. However, containers can be started or stopped at sub-second speeds,
// allowing your infrastructure to adapt itself in real time to meet system demands.
//
// Force12 is aimed at effectively using the resources you have right now - your existing VMs or physical servers - by using them as
// optimally as possible.
//
// The Force12 approach is analogous to the way that a router dynamically optimises the use of a physical network. A router is limited
// by the capacity of the lines physically connected to it. Adding additional capacity is a physical process and takes time. Routers
// therefore make decisions in real time about which packets will be prioritized on a particular line based on the packet's priority
// (defined by a "quality of service" contract).
//
// For example, at times of high bandwidth usage a router might prioritize VOIP traffic over web browsing in real time.
//
// Containers allow Force12 to make similar "instant" judgements on service prioritisation within your existing infrastructure. Routers
// make very simplistic judgments because they have limited time and cpu and they act at a per packet level. Force12 has the capability
// of making far more sophisticated judgements, although even fairly simple ones will still provide a significant new service.
//
// This prototype is a bare bones implementation of Force12.io that recognises only 1 demand type:
// randomised demand for a priority 1 service. Resources are allocated to meet this demand for priority 1, and spare resource can
// be used for a priority 2 service.
//
// These demand type examples have been chosen purely for simplicity of demonstration. In the future more demand types
// will be offered
